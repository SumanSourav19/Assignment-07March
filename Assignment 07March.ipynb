    "Ans) Skewness is a measurement of the distortion of symmetrical distribution or asymmetry in a data set. Skewness is demonstrated on a bell curve when data points are not distributed symmetrically to the left and right sides of the median on a bell curve. If the bell curve is shifted to the left or the right, it is said to be skewed."

    "Covariance and correlation greatly aid in understanding the relationship between two continuous variables. Covariance indicates whether two variables fluctuate in the same (positive covariance) or opposite direction (negative covariance). The numerical value of covariance has no importance; only the sign is relevant. Correlation, on the other hand, describes how a change in one variable leads to a change in the percentage of the second variable. Correlation ranges from -1 to +1. If the correlation value is 0, it suggests that there is no linear link between the variables, but another functional relationship may exist."
